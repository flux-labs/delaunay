#Delaunay Triangulation

This is a little function that computes the Delaunay triangulation for
a set of points. It is a fork of [ironwallaby/delaunay](https://github.com/ironwallaby/delaunay) with a different (not quite as efficient) output format and some tests.

It is intended to be used as a code block on [Flux](https://flux.io).
